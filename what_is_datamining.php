It is an essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns.It is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science.The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use.Aside from the raw analysis step, it involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.Data mining is the analysis step of the "knowledge discovery in databases" process, or KDD.</p><br>

                                Data Mining is similar to Data science .It is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured.</p><br>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">Here are some of its uses in various fields.</b>
                                </p><br>

                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">Healthcare:</b> Data mining holds great potential to improve healthcare systems. It uses data analytics to identify best practices that improve care and reduce costs.</p>
                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">Example:</b>
                                <br>data mining can help healthcare insurers detect fraud and abuse, healthcare organizations make customer relationship management decisions, physicians identify effective treatments and best practices, and patients receive better and more affordable healthcare services.

                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">Market Basket Analysis for Retailers:</b>Market basket analysis is a useful method of discovering customer purchasing patterns by extracting associations or co-occurrences from stores' transactional databases. Because the information obtained from the analysis can be used in forming marketing, sales, service, and operation strategies, it has drawn increased research interest. The existing methods, however, may fail to discover important purchasing patterns in a multi-store environment, because of an implicit assumption that products under consideration are on shelf all the time across all stores. In this paper, we propose a new method to overcome this weakness. Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method is computationally efficient, and that it has advantage over the traditional method when stores are diverse in size, product mix changes rapidly over time, and larger numbers of stores and periods are considered.</p>

                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">Education:</b> It helps in predicting students’ future learning behaviour, studying the effects of educational support, and advancing scientific knowledge about learning. Data mining can be used by an institution to take accurate decisions and also to predict the results of the student. </p>
                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">Example:</b>

It can also be used to predict the product development span time, cost, and dependencies among other tasks.</p>
                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">Example:</b>

                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">fraud detection</b>  fraud is not a new issue, the current financial crisis has enlightened that fraud occurs mainly during a recession, as compared with normal periods of economic growth.In these circumstances, in which development of the IT systems plays a central role in the creation of competitive companies, requiring the use of data analysis tools and programs. Since the companies usually operate with large volumes of data, it is absolutely necessary to implement such processes of continuous monitoring, We strive to provide an overview of the way in which technology can be implemented to improve fraud prevention and detection, inside of a public or private economic entity.

                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">Sports:</b>The sports world is known for the vast amounts of statistics that are collected for each player, team, game, and season.There are also many types of statistics that are gathered for each – a basketball player will have data for points,rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, etc for each game.This can result in information overload for those trying to derive meaning from the statistics. Hence,sports are ideal for data mining tools and techniques.Sports organizations,due to the extremely competitive environment in which theyoperate,need to seek any edge that will give them an advantage over others.It would appear that the culture has long encouraged analysis and discovery ofnew knowledge exhibited by its longstanding utilization of scouting.Currently, most team sports organizations employ in-house statisticians and analysts to retrieve meaning and insight for the scouts who evaluate future prospects and talent, the coaches who are in charge of the team on the playing surface, as well as the general managers who are in charge of drafting or signing players.

                                <b style="font-weight: 500;">Astronomy:</b>'Data Mining' can have a somewhat mixed connotation from the point of view of a researcher in this field. If used correctly, it can be a powerful approach, holding the potential to fully exploit the exponentially increasing amount of available data, promising great scientific advance. However, if misused, it can be little more than the black-box application of complex computing algorithms that may give little physical insight, and provide questionable results. Here, we give an overview of the entire data mining process, from data collection through to the interpretation of results. We cover common machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines, applications from a broad range of astronomy, emphasizing those where data mining techniques directly resulted in improved science, and important current and future directions, including probability density functions, parallel algorithms, petascale computing, and the time domain. We conclude that, so long as one carefully selects an appropriate algorithm, and is guided by the astronomical problem at hand, data mining can be very much the powerful tool, and not the questionable black box.
